Q3. Introduce ONE selected “Data Set” from the [awesome-datascience] GitHub with its URL and describe its potential applications and values?
> I found enigma (https://enigma.com/) to be quite intriguing. They sell data pertaining to small businesses. Smaller companies most of the times don’t have a good framework or infrastructure for tracking and storing huge volumes of transactions. Interestingly, enigma sources the raw data from common public, government websites and not directly from the business. And then segregates the data into smaller groups. With each group representing a business. Additionally, each group’s record are stored structurally with well-defined attributes.  
Enigma holds incredible potential. It allows users to predict basic factors like companies revenue, growth and health. This helps financiers/ investors and mitigates their risks. Also, enigma enables us to predict micro-industries’s  behaviour under unexpected conditions like recession, natural disaster or pandemics. This has been a completely unexplored field but Enigma might change the game now!

Q4. Introduce ONE selected “free-data-science-book” with its URL and author/institute information. Explain briefly why you are interested in this book.

>Book name: An Introduction to Data Science
>Author: Dr.Jeffrey Stanton 
>University: Syracuse University
>[Book](http://www.odbms.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/DataScienceBookV3.pdf)

> Introduction to Data Science by Jeffrey Stanton is a simple, easy to follow guide to the world of Data Science. It's not math heavy and gives relatable examples, which makes this an ideal book for any layman. Book covers central limit theorem and law of large from a Data Scientist's point of view, which is a bit unorthodox. The book utilizes R programming language, which is open-sourced and easier than traditional programming languages like Python and Scala. Furthermore, it covers tiddyverse package in depth and there are loads of simple exercises to boost confidence. All in all, I would higly recommend this book to anyone looking to enter the world of data science.
