Q3. Introduce ONE selected “Data Set” from the [awesome-datascience] GitHub with its URL and describe its potential applications and values?
> I found enigma (https://enigma.com/) to be quite intriguing. They sell data pertaining to small businesses. Smaller companies most of the times don’t have a good framework or infrastructure for tracking and storing huge volumes of transactions. Interestingly, enigma sources the raw data from common public, government websites and not directly from the business. And then segregates the data into smaller groups. With each group representing a business. Additionally, each group’s record are stored structurally with well-defined attributes.  
Enigma holds incredible potential. It allows users to predict basic factors like companies revenue, growth and health. This helps financiers/ investors and mitigates their risks. Also, enigma enables us to predict micro-industries’s  behaviour under unexpected conditions like recession, natural disaster or pandemics. This is a completely unexplored field because of lack but Enigma might change the game now!
